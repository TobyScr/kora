# ENV.md

## Environments
- Local Dev: <!-- e.g., http://localhost:3000 -->
- Staging URL: <!-- Add when available -->
- Production URL: <!-- Add when available -->

Always state clearly which environment is being tested.

## Authentication & Credentials

<!-- Define your authentication layers and test credentials here -->

Rules:
- Never paste passwords or tokens into chat, code, or markdown
- Use environment variables or manual login if required

## Test Data Assumptions

QA assumes the environment contains:
- At least one existing test record per tested feature
- Stable data that is not shared with real users

<!-- Add project-specific test data details here -->
