## QA Result: PASS

**Issue:** #22 - System Map - Add Challenges (Manual & AI-Generated)
**Mode:** Fast QA (desktop viewport)
**Date:** 2026-02-10

### Fixes Required

None.

### Passed

- "+ Add more" card click opens dropdown with "Fill manually" (pen icon) and "Generated by Kora" (sparkle icon) options
- Clicking outside the dropdown closes it
- "Fill manually" opens Add Challenge modal with empty fields, placeholder "Add your Challenge here" for title and "Describe your challenge" for description, character counter "0 / 100"
- Cancel button closes modal without adding a new card (grid remains at 8 cards)
- Add button is disabled when fields are empty; enabled when title is entered
- Typing a title and description then clicking Add creates a new card numbered 9 (next in sequence) and shows green "Challenge saved successfully" toast
- "Generated by Kora" immediately adds a skeleton card numbered 10 (next in sequence)
- Progress indicator appears at bottom showing "Generating Challenge" with percentage (observed 25%)
- Skeleton card populates with AI-generated content ("Digital literacy gaps in vulnerable populations") when generation completes
- Success toast "Challenge saved successfully" fires after both manual and AI-generated adds (confirmed in code, observed for manual add)
- "+ Add more" button is disabled while AI generation is in progress
- New cards have correct sequential numbering (original 1-8, manual add = 9, AI add = 10)
- After selecting an entry point and clicking "Confirm Entry Point", the System Map section collapses and the "+ Add more" card is no longer visible (read-only state)
- No TypeScript errors (tsc --noEmit clean)
- No console errors
- No console warnings
- Works on desktop viewport

### Not Tested
